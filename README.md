# Machine Learning for Detective Stories

The Repo is created for STA490 (Statistical Consulting) Course Project. In this project, I'm working on machine learning techniques to discover interesting facts for detective stories. The dataset inccludes one annotatetd dataset that includes all information about the stories (mostly categorical variables) and the texts of stories.

The current accomplished step is about doing clustering by tf-idf matrix of each stories, and we also try out hypothesis testing for checking the topic difference between different clusters. The next step might be lexicon-based sentiment analysis, or utilizing XGBoost for finding the most important component to a good detective story.
